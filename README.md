# Shaders

Various random shaders I wrote for fun.  

Use shadertoy VSC plug-in to check them out!

Also use the frame render script to render a specific frame.  

Usage :  
  
python3 frame_render.py "shader_file.glsl" iTime_value horizontal_resolution vertical_resolution  

iTime values are seconds (floats)  
resolutions are ints.
